This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

## Making vectors
```{r}
# Generates a contiguous list of values 
contiguous=2:10

# Generates a vector of numbers, booleans, and characters
vectorOfNumbers=c(43,6,2,45,2,8,3)
vectorOfBooleans=c(T,F,T,T,F)
vectorOfCharacterTypes=c('This','is','a','vector','with','character','types','as','components','.')

# Generates an empty vector
emptyVector=c()

# Creates a vector of 12 zeros
vectorOf12Zeros=numeric(12)
```

## Selecting a subset of a vector
```{r}
thirdElement=contiguous[3]
thirdAndFifthElements=vectorOfNumbers[c(3,5)]
allButThe4thElement=vectorOfCharacterTypes[-4]

temp=5
secondElementInAComplicatedButPotentiallyUsefulWay=vectorOfBooleans[temp-3]

# In the next command, 
# %% is the modulus operator,
# length() returns the length of a vector,
# which() returns positions where the vector is true
elementsInEvenPositions=vectorOfNumbers[which((1:length(vectorOfNumbers))%%2==0)] 

#Note - to understand what which() is doing, look at what the stuff inside it gives:
firstPartOfStuffInsideWhich=(1:length(vectorOfNumbers))
secondPartOfStuffInsideWhich=(1:length(vectorOfNumbers))%%2
allStuffInsideWhich=(1:length(vectorOfNumbers))%%2==0
```

## Loop through a vector and print every element
```{r}
for (i in vectorOfCharcterTypes)
{
  print(i)
}
```

## Do something 10 times using a for loop
```{r}
# To do this, use the vector 1:10 to drive the loop even if you don't actually use the numbers 1-10
for (i in 1:10){
  print('hi!') # or whatever you want to do 10 times
}
```

## Create the vector 101:2001 using an empty initial vector and a for loop
```{r}
vector101to2001=c()
for (i in 101:2001){
  vector101to2001=c(vector101to2001,i)
}
```


## Do different things on odd and even iterations of a loop. Use a for loop and an if-else statement. Note that if you only want to do something if [and not else] then don't include the else part
```{r}
for (i in 1:13){
  if (i %%2==1){ # %% is the modulus operator
    print('odd') # or whatever you want to do when i is odd
  } else {
    print('even') # or whatever you want to do when i is even
  }
}

```


## Calculate the 10th triangular number
```{r}
# Initialize a variable- otherwise R won't know what to do with the right side of the statement in the for loop [tri10+1] since it refers to tri10. Without initialization, tri10 won't exist and R will give you an error
tri10=0
# Do the calculation
for (i in 1:10){
  tri10=tri10+i
}
```

## Make a function to calculate a triangular number
```{r}
# n is an argument/variable passed in.
# this is used to represent which triangular number the function should calculate
calculateTriangularNumber<-function(n) 
{
  triN=0
  for (i in 1:n){
    triN=triN+i
  }
  # the part above is nearly identical to the 10th triangular number example.  Just with a variable (n) instead of 10
  
  return(triN)  # send the result back to the line that called it
}
```

## Use the function to calculate the 14th triangular number and store it in a variable
```{r}
tri14=calculateTriangularNumber(14)
```

## Take the numbers 11-30. Scramble them up without replacement and while keeping all 20.  Put them in a 4x5 array. Then add them up. Then print the answer
```{r}
numbersToAdd=11:30
scrambled=sample(numbersToAdd,20,replace=F)
grid=array(scrambled,dim=c(4,5))
sumOfGrid=0
for (i in 1:4){
  for (j in 1:5){
    sumOfGrid=sumOfGrid+grid[i,j]
  }
}
print(sumOfGrid)
```
## Take the numbers 11-30. Randomly select 12 of them with replacement.  Put them in a 3x4 array. Add up one random column.  Then print the answer
```{r}
numbersToChooseFrom=11:30
nToChoose=12
chosen12=sample(numbersToChooseFrom,nToChoose,replace=T)
grid=array(chosen12,dim=c(3,4))
columnToAdd=sample(1:4,1)
sumOfColumn=sum(grid[,columnToAdd])
print(sumOfColumn)
```

## Make the above code into a function and then use replicate() to get 1000 instances of sumOfColumn. Then make a histogram of the result with 20 bins
```{r}
sumRandomColumn<-function(vectorToChooseFrom){
  nToChoose=12
  chosen12=sample(vectorToChooseFrom,nToChoose,replace=T)
  grid=array(chosen12,dim=c(3,4))
  columnToAdd=sample(1:4,1)
  sumOfColumn=sum(grid[,columnToAdd])
  return(sumOfColumn)
}
oneThousandReplicates=replicate(1000,sumRandomColumn(41:57))
hist(oneThousandReplicates,20)
```

# R Programming Exercises
```{r}
# 1. Make a vector of numbers and store it in a variable. Be sure some of the numbers are greater than 3 and some less than 3.

# 2. Extract a non-contiguous subset of your vector and store that in a variable

# 3. Use the which() function to make a new vector with the positions of the elements of your vector that are greater than 3.

# 4. Write a for loop that calculates the mean of your vector - don't use the mean() or sum() functions for this

# 5. Make #4 into a function that takes a vector of numbers and input and returns the mean of the vector passed in [call the function myMean so that R doesn't confuse its built-in mean() function with yours]

# 6. Write a for loop that calculates the mean of the elements that are greater than 3 in your vector.  

# 7. Write a function that selects N numbers from the vector -100:100 at random and returns their mean [hint:  you can call your function from #5 as part of it!]

# 8. Plot three distributions [plot them as histograms] that you get by calling #7 5000 times.  In the first one, N is 4. In the 2nd N is 16. In the 3rd, N is 64.  How are the widths of these three distributions related to each other?

# 9. Write a function that does something to a vector of numbers and returns a single number back.  Inside the function must be at least one for loop and at least one if or if-else statement.  Be prepared to describe what your function does and how it works.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
